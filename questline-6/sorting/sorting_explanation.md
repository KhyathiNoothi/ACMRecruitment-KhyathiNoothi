# Sorting Challenge: Bubble Sort

## Algorithm Choice
I chose to implement **Bubble Sort** because it is simple to understand and easy to implement.

## How Bubble Sort Works
Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.

## Input List
[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]

## Step-by-step Sorting Process

| Pass | List after pass        |
|-------|------------------------|
| 1     | [2, 5, 1, 5, 6, 9]    |
| 2     | [2, 1, 5, 5, 6, 9]    |
| 3     | [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]    |

## Final Sorted List
[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
