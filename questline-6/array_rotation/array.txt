# Array Rotation

## Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

## Approach
- Use slicing to rotate the array.
- For `k` greater than array size, reduce it using `k = k % len(nums)`.
- Perform rotation using:
input:
nums=[1,2,3,45,6,7],k=3
output:
[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
